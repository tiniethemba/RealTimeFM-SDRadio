Welcome to the Real Time FM SDRadio

This repository contains the final year MEng project of Themba Kaonga.

It revolves around an application designed in MATLAB code which:

- Demodulates FM complex baseband data from an SDR
- Plays FM audio output to PC audio device
- Calculates & displays the channel SNR depending on SNR bandwidth range
- Uses SNR to estimate amount of in band FM stations 
- Can automatically sweep over the entire FM band to search for stations (88.5MHz-107.0MHz)
